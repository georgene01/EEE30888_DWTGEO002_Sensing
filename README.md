# Sensing Subsystem Resources for Micro Mouse PCB Design

## Introduction
Hello! My name is Georgene de Wet, and I am a third-year mechatronics student at the University of Cape Town. This repository contains the resources and design files for a PCB that forms part of the sensing subsystem for a micro mouse, developed as part of my electronic design course.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to design a reliable and efficient printed circuit board (PCB) that will enhance the sensing capabilities of a micro mouse used in maze navigation. The sensing subsystem is crucial as it detects obstacles and guides the micro mouse through the maze effectively.

## Repository Contents
- **Schematics**: Detailed circuit diagrams.
- **PCB Layouts**: Layout files that can be used for manufacturing the PCB.
- **Components List**: A list of all components required for the PCB.
- **Simulation Data**: Results and data from various simulations conducted during the design phase.
- **Documentation**: Additional project notes and design considerations.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Review the `Components List` to acquire necessary parts.
3. Use the `Schematics` and `PCB Layouts` for assembling and manufacturing.

## Contributing
As I am new to GitHub and continuously learning more about electronic design and PCB development, I welcome contributions, suggestions, and feedback. Please feel free to fork this repository, make changes, and submit a pull request.
