# Sensing Subsystem Resources for Micro Mouse PCB Design

## Introduction
Hello! My name is Georgene de Wet, and I am a third-year mechatronics student at the University of Cape Town. This repository contains the resources and design files for a PCB that forms part of the sensing subsystem for a micro mouse, developed as part of my electronic design course.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to design a reliable and efficient printed circuit board (PCB) that will enhance the sensing capabilities of a micro mouse used in maze navigation. The sensing subsystem is crucial as it detects obstacles and guides the micro mouse through the maze effectively.

## Repository Contents
- **Schematics**: Detailed circuit diagram. [Schematics](Schematics)
- **PCB Layouts**: Layout files, and position files that can be used for manufacturing the PCB. [PCB Layouts](PCB_Layouts)
- **Components List**: A list of all components required for the PCB, and their datasheets. [Components List](Components_List)
- **Simulation Data**: Results and data from various simulations conducted during the design phase. [Simulation Data](Simulation_Data)
- **Documentation**: Additional project notes and design considerations [Documentation](Documentation)
