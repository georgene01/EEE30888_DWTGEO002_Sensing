Sensing subsystem resources. PCB design for a micro mouse.

Hi, I'm Georgene de Wet

A third year mechatronics student at the University of Cape Town.

I'm currently working on develoing a pcb for the sensing subsytem of a micro mouse for my electronic design course. 

Ive only made one repository as I am very new to Github. 

But hope to use this platform to keep learning more and share my projects.
